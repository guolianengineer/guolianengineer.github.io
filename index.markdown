# Apple Supply Chain Operations Knowledge Base

This site documents practical knowledge, methods, and systems used in real-world engineering and product development environments.

---

## Languages  
Three fundamental languages is used in Apple supply chain. GD&T, Statistics, English.  
- **GD&T** : Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing,GD&T is a symbolic language used to describe design intent on engineering drawings. 
- **Statistics** : Statistics is the language used to understand, measure, and control variation.  While GD&T defines what is acceptable geometrically, Statistics determines whether production can consistently achieve it.
- **English** : English is the working language of international engineering environments.Clear technical English reduces ambiguity, improves efficiency, and strengthens collaboration across global teams.

## Manufacturing Technology  
*(How products are physically realized and assembled)*

Understanding how things are made is essential to good design.  
This section focuses on production processes and practical manufacturing constraints.

Includes:
- Welding  
- Bonding / Adhesives  
- Fastening systems  
- Machining & forming  
- Surface treatment  

---

## Product Development System  
*(How ideas move from concept to mass production)*

Beyond technical skills, engineering success depends on structured development processes.

Includes:
- Team roles (PM, ME, EE, SQE, DQE, etc.)  
- Design workflow  
- Development phases (EVT / DVT / PVT / MP)  
- Templates used in real projects  (FMEA / Cost mdeol / Yield bridge. etc.)

## Engineering Tools & Characterization  
*(How we validate, measure, and analyze materials and products)*

Engineering decisions rely on data and verification.

Includes:
- SEM  
- XRD  
- MTS  
- XPS / FTIR  
- TEM  
- Reliability testing  
- Failure analysis methods

## Company Operations  
*(How companies and supply chains are structured and operated)*

Engineering does not exist in isolation.  
Understanding operational logic improves decision-making and long-term growth.

Includes:
- Organizational structure  
- Supply chain systems  
- Cost structure & business logic  
- Vendor management  
- Decision-making frameworks
