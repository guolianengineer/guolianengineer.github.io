## Adhsive failure mode analysis

Do your FA lab use the right Epoxy for cross section?<br>

When samples are sent to FA Lab to do cross section, material propoties need to be taken into consideration.<br>
Especily when adhesive exist.<br>
Because if the epoxy 放热 temp is higher than the adhesive glass temp. the adhesive will 失效 while the epoxy curing.<br>
