Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive Down Selection Guide

Pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are a type of adhesive that forms a bond when pressure is applied to marry the adhesive with the adherend. They do not require water, solvent, or heat to activate the adhesive. PSAs are commonly used in tapes, labels, and stickers due to their ease of use and versatility.
Types of Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives:
1. Acrylic PSAs:
    - Characteristics: Good UV resistance, weatherability, and aging properties.
    - Applications: Outdoor signage, automotive tapes, and medical applications.
2. Rubber-based PSAs:
    - Characteristics: High initial tack, good adhesion to low surface energy materials.
    - Applications: Packaging tapes, masking tapes, and general-purpose applications.
3. Silicone PSAs:
    - Characteristics: Excellent temperature resistance, chemical resistance, and flexibility.
    - Applications: Electronics, aerospace, and high-temperature applications.
Selection Criteria for PSAs:
- Substrate Compatibility: Ensure the PSA is compatible with the materials being bonded.
- Environmental Conditions: Consider temperature, humidity, and exposure to chemicals.
- Mechanical Requirements: Evaluate the required shear strength, peel strength, and tack.
- Application Method: Determine if the PSA will be applied manually or with automated equipment.
- Regulatory Compliance: Ensure the PSA meets any industry-specific regulations or standards.
By carefully evaluating these factors, one can select the most appropriate pressure-sensitive adhesive for their specific application.
