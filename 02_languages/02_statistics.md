## Summary

Imagine what you could do here! At Apple, new ideas have a way of becoming extraordinary products, services, and customer experiences very quickly. We bring passion and dedication to your job and there's no telling what you could accomplish.

In this highly visible role, you will lead selection, implementation & optimization of iPhone manufacturing processes for mechanical enclosure machining, surface treatment. Lead team to design outstanding process based on product drawing and cosmetic requirements; mapping out proper process flow and ERS which includes selecting processing equipment, designing corresponding fixtures, initiating DOEs to find out the best recipe.

## Description

Apply your Mechanical Engineering experience and work multi-functionally with Product Design Engineering and Industrial Design to assess product features for manufacturability, and recommend capable production processes and equipment.

With multiple material machining experience, have expertise in CNC process development, assess CNC machining process flow, review CNC fixture design DFM and drive improvement, apply proper datum to minimize tolerance stack-up, scope machining program to improve process capability and optimize c/t, develop advanced cutters with proper coating for some special use such like high shinny surface, fine texture surface, minimize burrs by cutter improvement.

Lead the machine calibration criteria setup and implementation, figure out how to recover the machine accuracy by maintenance and or retrofit, down-select machine base on machine capability and process requirement, work with vendor to develop brand-new equipment from RFQ to machine validation, finally qualify machine and implementation to fulfill process requirement.

Working with suppliers to define and refine mechanical tool and fixtures, which can secure the dimension and cosmetic requirement, establish process capability and readiness.

Lead the c/t reduction in the NPI stage to hit the MP target.

Review/define vendor’s in process control spec base on downstream process and 2D drawing requirement, define part tolerance and specifications by demonstrating process capability to Product Designers and Industrial Designers.

Identify, research, develop, and qualify premier equipment manufacturers and suppliers to develop sophisticated equipment for special process use and fulfill supply chain requirement.

Provide leadership at manufacturing sites during development and product production ramp.

Coordination of activities and direction through clear communication between Asia and US-based teams, and vendors is a necessity.

Work closely with Manufacture Design Engineers in the development of above said processes.

Work with Global Supply Managers to assess facility, floor layout, provide engineering support to secure deliver material to downstream CM vendor on time and on cost.

Work with Manufacture Quality Engineers to drive yield improvement through SPC, Pareto data review to take activities accordingly.

## Minimum Qualifications

- BS or equivalent experience or above in Mechanical / Industrial Engineering and/or relevant manufacturing work experience.
- 5+ years relevant hands-on experience and technical knowledge in fixture design, CNC process and cutter design in consumer electronics industry.
- Familiar with CAD/CAM/JMP software and GD&T to make data driven decisions.
- Good written and oral communication skills, proficient in both English and Mandarin. 

## Preferred Qualifications

- Has experience in either Titanium or metal components manufacturing processes including MIM, additive manufacturing (e.g. LPBF, DMD).
- Other process knowledge such as raw material, assembly, testing, and experiences in developing customized machine (non-standard machine) are preferred.
- Experience in AIML and lean factory.
- Familiar with FEA tools such as SEM, XRD, MTS, XPS, FTIR, RIB, TEM, etc.
- Familiar with Phyton/C++/SQL software.
- Familiar with CAE or simulation tools.
- On-site build support; must be willing to work from OEM factories. 
- A great teammate who is self-motivated, results oriented and detailed oriented. 
- Ability and willingness to work independently and travel frequently in Asia.
