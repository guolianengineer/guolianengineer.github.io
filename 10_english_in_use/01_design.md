Hello  
Here is the daily english used in real working.  

# 1. Drawings

## A. Drawing types and scales

In engineering, most design information is shown on **drawings**. Today, drawings are generally not drawn by hand. They are produced on computer, using **CAD** (computer-aided design) systems.  

A key factor on a drawing is the **scale** - that is, the size of items on the drawing in relation to their real size. When all the items on a drawing are shown relative to their real size, the drawing is **drawn to scale**, and can be called a scale drawing. An example of a scale is 1:10 (one to ten). **At 1:10**, an object with a length of 100 mm in real life would measure 10 mm on the drawing.  

Most engineering designs consist of **a set of drawings** (a number of related drawings):  
- **General arrangement (GA) drawings**  
GA drawings show whole devices or structures, using a small scale. This means objects on the drawing are small, relative to their real size (for example, a 1:100 drawing of an entire building).  

- **Detail drawings**  
Detail drawings show parts in detail, using a **large scale**, such as 1:5 or 1:2. Small parts are sometimes shown in a detail as **actual size** (1:1), or can be enlarged to bigger than actual size (for example, 2:1).  

For electrical circuits, and pipe and duct networks, it is helpful to show designs in a simplified form. In this case, **schematic drawings** (often referred to as schematics) are used. An everyday example is the map of a train network.

Notes: When written, drawing is often abbreviated to **dwg**.  
CAD is pronounced as a word: /kaed/.  

## B. Types of views used on drawings
Technicians are discussing different views shown on drawings (looking at components from above, from the side, etc.), as they search for the information they require.

We use a view from above showing the general arrangement of all of the roof panels - a plan of the whole area.
