    "content": "In engineering, most design information is shown on drawings. Today, drawings are generally not drawn by hand. They are produced on computer, using CAD (computer-aided design) systems. A key factor on a drawing is the scale - that is, the size of items on the drawing in relation to their real size. When all the items on a drawing are shown relative to their real size, the drawing is drawn to scale, and can be called a scale drawing. An example of a scale is 1:10 (one to ten). At 1:10, an object with a length of 100 mm in real life would measure 10 mm on the drawing. Most engineering designs consist of a set of drawings (a number of related drawings): . | General arrangement (GA) drawings GA drawings show whole devices or structures, using a small scale. This means objects on the drawing are small, relative to their real size (for example, a 1:100 drawing of an entire building). | Detail drawings Detail drawings show parts in detail, using a large scale, such as 1:5 or 1:2. Small parts are sometimes shown in a detail as actual size (1:1), or can be enlarged to bigger than actual size (for example, 2:1). | . For electrical circuits, and pipe and duct networks, it is helpful to show designs in a simplified form. In this case, schematic drawings (often referred to as schematics) are used. An everyday example is the map of a train network. Notes: When written, drawing is often abbreviated to dwg. CAD is pronounced as a word: /kaed/. ",

    "title": "1.1 originates",
    "content": "For many in the manufacturing sector, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) is a new subject. During World War II, the United States manufactured and shipped spare parts overseas for the war effort. Many of these parts, even though they were made to specifications, would not assemble. The military recognized that defective parts caused serious problems for military personnel. After the war, a committee representing government, industry, and education spent considerable time and effort investigating this defective parts problem; this group needed to find a way to ensure that parts would fit and function properly every time. The result was the development of GD&amp;T. Ultimately, the USASI Y14.5–1966 (United States of America Standards Institute, predecessor to the American National Standards Institute) document was produced based on earlier standards and industry practices. The following are revisions to that standard: . ANSI Y14.5–1973 (American National Standards Institute) ANSI Y14.5M–1982 ASME Y14.5M–1994 (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) ASME Y14.5–2009 ASME Y14.5–2018 . The 2018 revision is the current, authoritative reference document that specifies the proper application of GD&amp;T. Most government contractors are now required to generate drawings that are toleranced with GD&amp;T. Because of tighter tolerancing requirements, shorter time to production, and the need to communicate design intent more accurately, many companies other than military suppliers are recognizing the importance of tolerancing their drawings with GD&amp;T. Traditional tolerancing methods have been in use since the mid-1800s. These methods do a good job of dimensioning and tolerancing the size of features and are still used in that capacity today, but they do a poor job of locating and orienting features of size. GD&amp;T is used extensively for tolerancing size, shape, form, orientation, and location of features. Tolerancing with GD&amp;T has a number of advantages over conventional tolerancing methods; three dramatic advantages are illustrated in this chapter. The purpose of this introductory chapter is to provide an understanding of what GD&amp;T is and why it was developed, when to use it, and what advantages it has over conventional tolerancing methods. With a knowledge of this subject, technical practitioners will be more likely to understand tolerancing in general. With this new skill, engineers will have a greater understanding of how parts assemble, do a better job of communicating design requirements, and ultimately be able to make a greater contribution to their companies’ bottom line.

    "content": "GD&amp;T is a symbolic language. It is used to specify the size, shape, form, orientation, and location of features on a part. Features toleranced with GD&amp;T reflect the actual relationship between mating parts. Drawings with properly applied geometric tolerancing provide the best opportunity for uniform interpretation and cost-effective assembly. GD&amp;T was created to ensure the proper assembly of mating parts, to improve quality, and to reduce cost. GD&amp;T is a design tool. Before designers can apply geometric tolerancing properly, they must carefully consider the fit and function of each feature of every part. GD&amp;T, in effect, serves as a checklist to remind the designer to consider all aspects of each feature. GD&amp;T allows the designer to specify the maximum available tolerance and, consequently, design the most economical parts. Properly applied geometric dimensioning and tolerancing ensures that every part will assemble every time. GD&amp;T communicates design requirements. This tolerancing scheme identifies all applicable datum features, that is, reference surfaces, and the features being controlled to these datum features. A properly toleranced drawing not only is a picture that communicates the shape and size of the part but also tells a story that explains the tolerance relationships between features. ",
